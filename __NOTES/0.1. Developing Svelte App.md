# Developing Svelte App

ITS A GOOD WAY TO PRACTICE SVELTE A LITTLE BIT AND ALSO TO HAVE SOME CODE WHEN LEARNING TO TEST WITH CYPRESS

WE WILL USE daisyui

```
npx svelte-add tailwindcss --daisyui
```

# FOR THE DATBASE WE ARE GOING TO USE SQLite3 AND WE ARE GOING TO USE PRISMA

LETS INSTALL PRISMA

```
yarn add prisma 
```

```
yarn add @prisma/client --dev
```

I WROTE A CLIENT LOGIC IN HERE

```
cat src/lib/prisma/index.ts
```

**INITIALIZE PRISMA**

```
npx prisma init
```

PRISMA FILES ARE CREATED

LETS NOW WRITE A SCHEMA

```
cat prisma/schema.prisma
```

**LETS GENERATE CLIENT**

```
npx prisma generate
```

**PUSH OUR TABLES (SCHEMA) DEFINISTIONS TO DATBASE**

DATABSE FILE WILL BE CREATED: **`prisma/dev.db`**; BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW **`SQLITE IS DATABASE LOCATED IN FLAT FILE`**

# I WON'T BE NOTING DEVELOPED THINGS IN HERE

BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO EXPLAINING SVELTE; BECAUSE THIS IS CYPRESS WORKSHOP AND ACCENT SHOULD BE PLACED ON CYPRESS

**IF I ASUME THAT SOMETHING IS IMPORTANT I AM GOING TO EXPLAIN IT OVER HERE:**
