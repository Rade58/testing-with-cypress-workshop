# Developing Svelte App

ITS A GOOD WAY TO PRACTICE SVELTE A LITTLE BIT AND ALSO TO HAVE SOME CODE WHEN LEARNING TO TEST WITH CYPRESS

WE WILL USE daisyui

```
npx svelte-add tailwindcss --daisyui
```

# FOR THE DATBASE WE ARE GOING TO USE SQLite3 AND WE ARE GOING TO USE PRISMA

LETS INSTALL PRISMA

```
yarn add prisma 
```

```
yarn add @prisma/client --dev
```

I WROTE A CLIENT LOGIC IN HERE

```
cat src/lib/prisma/index.ts
```
