# Setting up

I INSTALLED CYPRESS FIRST

```
yarn add cypress --dev
```

YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS TO RUN CYPRESS

```bash
# this is used when you have CI/CD process
cypres run
```

**WE ARE GOING TO RUN**

```
npx cypress open
```
 
AN APP WILL OPEN (I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IT) (I'M ASUMING CYPRESS IS ELECTRON APP BUT I'LL LOOK INTO THAT LATER)

YOU CAN EXIT THIS APP

IN NEXT LECTION WE ARE GOING TO DEVELOP SVELTE APP (BECAUE WE WANT TO HAVE SOME THINGS TO TEST)
