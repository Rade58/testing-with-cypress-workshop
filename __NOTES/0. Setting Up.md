# Setting up

I INSTALLED CYPRESS FIRST

```
yarn add cypress --dev
```

YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS TO RUN CYPRESS

```bash
# this is used when you have CI/CD process
cypres run
```

**WE ARE GOING TO RUN**

```
npx cypress open
```
 
AN APP WILL OPEN

SOME FILES WILL BE GENERATED IN YOUR PROJECT

THEN YOU CAN CHOOSE BROWSERS OL ELECTRON APP

I PICKED UP EDGE BROWSER

YOU CAN CHOOSE WHAT TYPE OF SKAFFOLD OF YOUR PROJECT YOU WANT TO START IN
