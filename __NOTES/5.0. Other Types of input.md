# Other types of input

WE AE GOING TO WRITE TESTS FOR THE `http://localhost:3000/secret-menu` OF OUR APP

WE ALREADY WAS CHECKING THE BOXEX WITH .check; WE WILL DO THIS AGAIN; BUT WE DIDN'T USE SELECT ELEMENT AND ITS OPTIONS; FOR THAT PURPOSES WE HAVE `.select` METHOD 

BUT THERE IS ALSO INPUT TYPE RANGE, FOR WHICH WE CAN USE `invoke` WHERE WE CAN SET A VALUE AND THEN WE CAN USE `trigger`
