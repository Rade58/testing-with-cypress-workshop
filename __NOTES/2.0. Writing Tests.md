# LETS CREATE SOME TESTS

<https://github.com/Rade58/cypress-lessons/blob/main/lessons/3.%20Writing%20Tests.md>

YOU CAN DO THIS FROM DASHBOARD

LETS TRY IT 

ASUMING THAT YOU STARTED YOUR APP (`yarn dev`) AND

ASUMING YOUR DASBOARD IS OPEN, IF NOT OPEN IT (`npx cypress open`)

JUST CLICK ON <kbd>`+ Add Ne Spec`</kbd>

**WHEN YOU DO THIS YOU WILL SE THAT CYPRESS WANTS TO CEATE TYPESCRIPT FILE**

I HAD FRIENDLY REMINDER FROM SOME DEVELOPERS THAT I SHOULD USE ONLY JS FILE; MAYBE THATS NOT IMPORTANT

I JUST ALTERET PATH TO BE JAVASCRIPT (FROM DASHBOARD)

ALSO I GOT SOME GENERATED describe BLOCK

A NEW FILE IS OFCOURSE CREATED

**ALSO A FRIENDLY REMINDER IS TO ADD THIS ON TOP OF THE FILE**

```js
/// <reference types="cypress" />
```

YOU CAN CREATE SNIPPET IN VS CODE FOR ABOVE

THIS FILE WAS GENERATED (O NAMED HIM LIKE THIS)

IMPORTAT IS THAT IT NEEDS TO BE INSIDE `e2e` FOLDER

```
cat cypress/e2e/01-first/1-first-spec.cy.js
```

```js
/// <reference types="cypress" />

describe('empty spec', () => {
	it('passes', () => {
		cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io');
	});
});

```

# LETS WRITE SOME TESTS

```js
/// <reference types="cypress" />

describe('Create New Item', () => {
	// FIRST LETS VISIT THE CORRECT PAGE
	// BUT LET DEFINE THAT WE WANT TO DO THAT
	// BEFORE EACH TEST IN THIS DESCRIBE BLOCK
	beforeEach(() => {
		cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/crypto-pooper');
	});

	// LETS MAKE A SIMPLE ASSERTION

	it('should have a form', () => {
		cy.get('form').should('exist');
	});

	// WE NEED TO UNDERSTND WHEN CYPRESS SUCCEDS AND WHEN IT FAILS
	// FOR EXAMPLE JEST WILL FAIL IF THERE IS NO ASSERTIONS
	// BUT NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT THE CSE WITH CYPRESS

	// CYPRESS WILLL SUCCED EVEN YOU JUST VISITED PAGE
	// OR YOU JUST FIND AN ELEMENT

	// SO FAR I KNOW THAT CYPRESS WILL FAIL IF YOU MAK A
	// WRONG ASSERTION OR IF ELEMENT CAN'T BE FOUND

	// THIS ONE WILL FAIL

	it(' should have a special "formmmmm" element', () => {
		cy.get('formmmmmm');
	});
	// AND THIS ONE WILL FAIL

	it('form shouldn`t exist', () => {
		cy.get('form').should('not.exist');
	});

	// ALSO IF YOU ARE MAKING AN ACTIN ON THE
	// ELEMENT THAT DOESN'T

	it('write text in a button', () => {
		cy.get('[data-test="add-coin"]').type('foo bar');
	});

	// THIS WILL ALSO FAILE, SINCE WE ARE TRYING TO CLICK DISABLED
	// BUTTON

	it('click on disabled button', () => {
		cy.get('button[data-test=add-coin][disabled]').click();
	});
});

```

## WE CAN ALSO ASSERT FAILURE IF ACTION FAILS; BUT WE NEED TO USE EVENTS FOR THIS

```js
/// <reference types="cypress" />

describe('Create New Item', () => {
	beforeEach(() => {
		cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/crypto-pooper');
	});

	// THIS HANDLER CAN HAVE ARGUMENT done
	it('should fail if user clickkss on disabled button', (done) => {
		cy.get('[data-test=add-coin][disabled]').click();

		// NOW WE USE HANDLER
		cy.once('fail', (err) => {
			expect(err.message).to.include('this element is `disabled`');
			// BECAUSE TEST IS ASYNCHRONOUS YOU NEED TO USE done
			done();
		});
	});
});

```

## IF YOU FORGOT SOMETHING SEE IT HERRE

SEE FULL TEST AT THE END (W USED type TOO)

# EXERCISE FOR THE src/routes/crypto-pooper APP

TEST FOR

- Adding a new coin
- Filtering the coins on the page
- Removing all of the coins from the page
- Removing a coin from the page
- Marking all of the coins as shitcoins
- Marking an individual coin as shitcoin
