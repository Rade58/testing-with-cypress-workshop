# LETS CREATE SOME TESTS

<https://github.com/Rade58/cypress-lessons/blob/main/lessons/3.%20Writing%20Tests.md>

YOU CAN DO THIS FROM DASHBOARD

LETS TRY IT 

ASUMING THAT YOU STARTED YOUR APP (`yarn dev`) AND

ASUMING YOUR DASBOARD IS OPEN, IF NOT OPEN IT (`npx cypress open`)

JUST CLICK ON <kbd>`+ Add Ne Spec`</kbd>

**WHEN YOU DO THIS YOU WILL SE THAT CYPRESS WANTS TO CEATE TYPESCRIPT FILE**

I HAD FRIENDLY REMINDER FROM SOME DEVELOPERS THAT I SHOULD USE ONLY JS FILE; MAYBE THATS NOT IMPORTANT

I JUST ALTERET PATH TO BE JAVASCRIPT (FROM DASHBOARD)

ALSO I GOT SOME GENERATED describe BLOCK

A NEW FILE IS OFCOURSE CREATED

**ALSO A FRIENDLY REMINDER IS TO ADD THIS ON TOP OF THE FILE**

```js
/// <reference types="cypress" />
```

THIS FILE WAS GENERATED (O NAMED HIM LIKE THIS)

IMPORTAT IS THAT IT NEEDS TO BE INSIDE `e2e` FOLDER

```
cat cypress/e2e/01-first/1-first-spec.cy.js
```

```js
/// <reference types="cypress" />

describe('empty spec', () => {
	it('passes', () => {
		cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io');
	});
});

```
