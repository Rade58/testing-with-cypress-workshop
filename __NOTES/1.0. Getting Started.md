# Getting started and Anathomy of the tests

WE ARE GOING TO WRITE OUR TESTS USING JAVASCRIPT

# LETS MAKE cypress FOLDER (you don't need to do this because when you choose to configure e2e, folders and files are going to be generated)

**ALL THE FOLDERS WERE THERE BECAUSE I DID CHOOSE SKAFFOLD OF THE PROJECT, THE FIRST TIME I RUNNED CYPRESS**

INSIDE cypress FOLDER THERE SHOULD BE FOLDERS INTEGRATION TESTS, FOR THE DATA WE WANT TO USE DURING TESTS, FOLDER FOR THE COMMANDS, AND A FOLDER FOR PLUGINS, FOLDER FOR END TO END TEST

```
ls cypress/{integration,fixtures,support,plugins,e2e}
```

OUR ONLY TYPESCRIPT FILE IS GOING TO BE `cypress/plugins/index.ts`

I MADE THIS FILE EARLIER

```
touch cypress/plugins/index.ts
```

THERE WE DID DEFINE LOGIC FOR RESETING AND SEEDING OUR DATABASE BEFORE RUNNING TESTS

# ADDED SOME DATA FILES (JSON) INSIDE fixtures FOLDER

HERE: `cypress/fixtures`

# I SKAFFOLDED THIS INTEGRATION TEST 

```
touch cypress/integration/01-first-flight.spec.js
```

```js
/// <reference types="cypress" />

describe('Create a New Item', () => {});

```

# LETS NOW OPEN CYPRESS

```
npx cypress open
```

# LETS NOW START END TO END TESTING IN MICROSOFT EDGE (I CHOOSE THAT OPTION)

THE EDGE BROWSER WINDOOW IS GENERATED; THERE I HAVE A DASBOARD FOR END TO END TESTING OF MY APP

I CHOOSE SOME FIRST TEST GENEERATED BY CYPRESS TO RUN; IT'S AN EXAMPLE APP DEPLOYED ON <https://example.cypress.io/>

FOR THE REST INFO CHECK YOUR LESSONS NOTES I LEFT ON THE BEGGINING OF THIS DOC

<https://github.com/Rade58/cypress-lessons/blob/main/lessons/0.%20Getting%20Started.md#running-your-tests>

# I'M NOTICING NOW FEW THINGS; `cypress/integration` FOLDER IS NOT BEING USED ANYMORE

I MADE THIS FOLDER ACCORDING TO SOME PREVIOUS VERSION OF CYPRESS BUT I THINK NOW; THE FOLDER WITH TESTS IS GENERATED BY CYPRES AND THI IS THAT FOLDER:

**`cypress/e2e`**

I WILL MAKE ONE TET HERE TO SEE IF IT IS GOING TO WORK

I THINK I NEED TO PREFIX EXTENSSION WITH `cy` INSTEAD OF `spec`

YES I WAS RIGHT, WHEN I CREATED THIS FILE, IT WAS IMMEDIATELLY REGISTERED INSIDE DASBOARD

# I MADE ONE NEW TEST

```
mkdir cypress/e2e/3-foo
```

```
touch cypress/e2e/3-foo/01-foo.cy.js
```

```js
/// <reference types="cypress" />

describe('Foo test', () => {
	it('goes to the google page', () => {
		cy.visit('https://google.com');
	});
});

```

I CLICKED ON THE TEST IN THE DASBOARD AND IT REALLY WORKED

IFRAME ON THE RIGHT DID REALLY OPENED GOOGLE PAGE

# LETS AGAIN SEE WHAT WE DO HAVE IN OUR DASBOARD

WE FIRST PICK A BROWSER

THEN OUR DASBOARD OPENS

THE LEFT ARE TEST, AND THINGS ARE SELF EVIDENT ON THE FAR LEFT WHERE SOME BUTTUNS ARE

OUR TEST ARE INSIDE `Spec` TAB

YOU CLICK ON TEST AND IT WILL RUN

ON THE RIGHT IS DASBOARD WITH IFRAMED WEBPAGE

## 1. TARGET SIGN NEAR THE ADDRESS BAR

YOU CAN USE IT TO TARGET SELECTORS FROM THE CONTEXT OF YOUR TEST

## 2. YOU CAN ALSO SEE HOW CYPRESS IS DOING THE SLECTION

```js
cy.get(`[data-test="new-todo"]`)
```

## A word on selectors

<https://github.com/Rade58/cypress-lessons/blob/main/lessons/0.%20Getting%20Started.md#a-word-on-selectors>


# ANATHOMY OF THE TESTS

WHEN YOU HOVER OVER THE TEST INSIDE DASBOARD, THERE IS `Open in IDE` BUTTON

I SELECTED VSCode

A TEST FILE IS NOW OPENED IN MY VSCode

**THIS FILE IS OPENED `cypress/e2e/1-getting-started/todo.cy.js`**

CYPRESS USES Mocha AND chi UNDER THE HOOD

YOU HAVE YOUR `describe` AND `it` BLOCKS

THERE ARE ALSO `beforeEach` INSIDE describe, IT RUNS BEFORE EACH TEST INSIDE describe BLOCK

# FINDING DOM NODES

`cy.get`

IT ACTS LIKE `document.querySelector`

**DIFFERENCE BETWENN document.querySelector AND cy.get:**

- `document.querySelector` will return empty collection if it can't find an element on the page

- `cy.get` WILL CONTINUE TRYING GETTING ELEMENTS UNTILL IT IS SUCCESFULL IN FINDING OUT, **OR AGREED UPON TIMEOUT IS GOING TO EXPIRE**

**OFCOURSE THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR CYPRESS BECAUSE SOMETIMES IN OUR APP WE ARE MOUNTING UPON SUCCESSFULL NETWORK REQUEST, OR WE ARE INSERTING SOME ELEMENT DEPENDING ON SOME OTHER THING; IN POINT OF VIEW OF CYPRESS, THE ELEENTS ARE NOT THERE BUT THEY CAN BE IN A FEW MOMENTS**

# TEST CODE LOOKS SYNCHRONOUS BUT IT IS NOT

<https://github.com/Rade58/cypress-lessons/blob/main/lessons/2.%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20Test.md#a-word-on-asynchrony>

>> Cypress runs all of your directions asynchronouslyâ€”allowing it to retry and whatnot, but it saves us from having to use await before every line because we're calling methods on the `cy` object, which is basically queuing our commands and running them in order.

# FINDING ELEMENTS IN A PAGE (TRAVERSING THE DOM)

`cy.get`

`cy.contains`
