# Getting started

<https://github.com/Rade58/cypress-lessons/blob/main/lessons/0.%20Getting%20Started.md>


WE ARE GOING TO WRITE OUR TESTS USING JAVASCRIPT

# LETS MAKE cypress FOLDER

**ALL THE FOLDERS WERE THERE BECAUSE I DID CHOOSE SKAFFOLD OF THE PROJECT, THE FIRST TIME I RUNNED CYPRESS**

INSIDE cypress FOLDER THERE SHOULD BE FOLDERS INTEGRATION TESTS, FOR THE DATA WE WANT TO USE DURING TESTS, FOLDER FOR THE COMMANDS, AND A FOLDER FOR PLUGINS, FOLDER FOR END TO END TEST

```
ls cypress/{integration,fixtures,support,plugins,e2e}
```

OUR ONLY TYPESCRIPT FILE IS GOING TO BE `cypress/plugins/index.ts`

I MADE THIS FILE EARLIER

```
touch cypress/plugins/index.ts
```

THERE WE DID DEFINE LOGIC FOR RESETING AND SEEDING OUR DATABASE BEFORE RUNNING TESTS

# ADDED SOME DATA FILES (JSON) INSIDE fixtures FOLDER

HERE: `cypress/fixtures`

# I SKAFFOLDED THIS INTEGRATION TEST 

```
touch cypress/integration/01-first-flight.spec.js
```

```js
/// <reference types="cypress" />

describe('Create a New Item', () => {});

```


# LETS NOW OPEN CYPRESS

```
npx cypress open
```

# LETS NOW START END TO END TESTING IN MICROSOFT EDGE (I CHOOSE THAT OPTION)

THE EDGE BROWSER WINDOOW IS GENERATED; THERE I HAVE A DASBOARD FOR END TO END TESTING OF MY APP

I CHOOSE SOME FIRST TEST GENEERATED BY CYPRESS TO RUN; IT'S AN EXAMPLE APP DEPLOYED ON <https://example.cypress.io/>

FOR THE REST INFO CHECK YOUR LESSONS NOTES I LEFT ON THE BEGGINING OF THIS DOC

<https://github.com/Rade58/cypress-lessons/blob/main/lessons/0.%20Getting%20Started.md#running-your-tests>

# I'M NOTICING NOW FEW THINGS; `cypress/integration` FOLDER IS NOT BEING USED ANYMORE

I MADE THIS FOLDER ACCORDING TO SOME PREVIOUS VERSION OF CYPRESS BUT I THINK NOW; THE FOLDER WITH TESTS IS GENERATED BY CYPRES AND THI IS THAT FOLDER:

**`cypress/e2e`**

I WILL MAKE ONE TET HERE TO SEE IF IT IS GOING TO WORK

I THINK I NEED TO PREFIX EXTENSSION WITH `cy` INSTEAD OF `spec`

YES I WAS RIGHT, WHEN I CREATED THIS FILE, IT WAS IMMEDIATELLY REGISTERED INSIDE DASBOARD

# I MADE ONE NEW TEST

```
mkdir cypress/e2e/3-foo
```

```
touch cypress/e2e/3-foo/01-foo.cy.js
```

```js
/// <reference types="cypress" />

describe('Foo test', () => {
	it('goes to the google page', () => {
		cy.visit('https://google.com');
	});
});

```

I CLICKED ON THE TEST IN THE DASBOARD AND IT REALLY WORKED

IFRAME ON THE RIGHT DID REALLY OPENED GOOGLE PAGE
