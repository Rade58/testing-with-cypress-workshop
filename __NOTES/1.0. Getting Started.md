# Getting started

<https://github.com/Rade58/cypress-lessons/blob/main/lessons/0.%20Getting%20Started.md>


WE ARE GOING TO WRITE OUR TESTS USING JAVASCRIPT

# LETS MAKE cypress FOLDER

ALSO, INSIDE cypress FOLDER, LETS MAKE FOLDER FOR OUT INTEGRATION TESTS, FOR THE DATA WE WANT TO USE DURING TESTS, FOLDER FOR THE COMMANDS, AND A FOLDER FOR PLUGINS

```
mkdir -p cypress/{integration,fixtures,support,plugins}
```

OUR ONLY TYPESCRIPT FILE IS GOING TO BE `cypress/plugins/index.ts`

```
touch cypress/plugins/index.ts
```

THERE WE DID DEFINE LOGIC FOR RESETING AND SEEDING OUR DATABASE BEFORE RUNNING TESTS

# ADDED SOME DATA FILES (JSON) INSIDE fixtures FOLDER

HERE: `cypress/fixtures`

# I SKAFFOLDED THIS INTEGRATION TEST 

```
touch cypress/integration/01-first-flight.spec.js
```

```js
/// <reference types="cypress" />

describe('Create a New Item', () => {});

```


# LETS NOW OPEN CYPRESS

```
npx cypress open
```
